      <h2 class="text-title">how it all started</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Nikita Zaitsev. I was born in a middle-class family and that middle class in Russia is not the same as in
        the USA… it’s much worse. Our family was one of those who really hoped for education, so my parents put me in an
        expensive private school with their last money. Although I studied at a private school (ofc they didn’t teach me
        anything about money, but I’m still grateful to my parents because they wanted the best for me), I was the
        poorest of the students. This aroused in me a wild desire to get rich, since I studied with the children of
        deputies and businessmen and they always had the latest iPhones, expensive clothes, etc. I was jealous. I really
        wanted to live like them but I wanted to achieve all this on my own and not at the expense of my parents.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-title">pathfinding and negative experiences</h2>

      <p>
        So I started looking for ways to make money. It all started with self-development. I read a ton of different
        books… I tried everything. I read affirmations, did self-suggestion, meditations, read mantras and all sorts of
        bullshit and that’s all in the 10th grade. After a 2 years of such shit, I began to realize that without action,
        nothing would come to me by itself XDDD. And then somehow I found out that people make big money on YouTube so I
        started doing YouTube. I bought a course for my last savings. At that time it was about $100 and it was a lot of
        money for me because I earned it working as a waiter in a cafe. And I watched all video that course had and i
        realized that I was fucked. The course was crap and the person who sold this course was a scammer. But I didn’t
        give up and just started making videos on YouTube. I tried a variety of niches. 10 fucking months and no result.
        It was so bad that I went into a deep depression. Yes, that happens. It turns out that you can’t always win with
        perseverance.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-title">and finally success</h2>
      <p>
        After 3 months of depression and procrastination, i decided that i would rather suffer to achieve success than
        suffer from procastination. I completely changed my approach to finding a way to get rich and did a big research
        and found this ai (you can read more about it and how to make money on it on their <a
          href="https://warriorplus.com/o2/a/vjfm0n/0">website</a>) and I created my own chat bot and started promoting
        it using social networks. It took 2 months for the bot to start bringing me income. After 2 months of hard work my bot bring me around $3,000 in one month (you can fing it in telegram just type "ChatGPT - Telegram Adaptation") every month the income grew, I received the money I invested back in this bot and in the crypt, so in 4 months I reached a stable income of $15,000, of course, most of my income is crypt, but the first big (at least for me at that time) money brought my bot. Now I am living the life of my dreams, I am still trying to raise my income level, because there is never a lot of money, And you can also start earning
        even if you don’t sell this bot after all, this is just beginning, it's like bitcoin in 2015, whoever manages to get on board will earn good money. You can easily start making money yourself using this bot. On the <a
          href="https://warriorplus.com/o2/a/vjfm0n/0">site</a>, you can read how you can use it to make money. So if
        you really want to start making some money, start with ai. We are now at the hype stage and only the fastest
        will get a piece of the money pie. I wish you also to achieve success, good luck.
